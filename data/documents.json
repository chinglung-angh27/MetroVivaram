    "summary": " The Kochi Metro Rail project has been planned by Government of Kerala . Around 25 km length metro line with 22 stations with Maintenance Depot at  Muttom will be developed between A luva to Petta .  Kochi Metro Rail project does not require environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment & Forest (MoEF) Kochi metro will have 22 stations . The main objective of this study is to document the assessment of environmental impacts associated  with development of metro rail along with associated Environment Monitoring Plans .  The proposed rolling stock shall have design speed of 90 kmph and maximum  running speed of 80 kmph . Average commercial speed will be 33 kmph; average commercial speed of 33kmph . CBTC system  will be used for signaling and train control . The train composition will be as follows:  Sitting-20, Crush Standing-839, 1 unit of Driving Motor Car .  The proposed viaduct structure for the Kochi Met ro is pre-stressed concrete deck, carrying two tracks . Two receiving sub stations (110 / 33 kV) are proposed to be set up for the proposed project .  The Kochi Metro Rail Ltd. has built a number of new platforms in Kochi, Kerala . The new platforms are designed for the city's commuter rail network . The platforms are located in the middle of the city centre .  In formulating the baseline environmental monitoring plan MoEF guidelines along with the various Indian Standards (IS) by Bureau of Indian Standards were followed . To assess the baseline envi ronmen tal status of the proposed project area, primary baseline m onitoring  had been conducted at various locations .  Kochi Metro project is planned in well developed urban areas,  so the soil samples were collected from Muttom area where maintenan ce depot is planned . The soil of the region can be  broadly classified into two categories i.e, alluvial and lateritic .  The proposed route is passing through the creek and canal in seven locations . Kochi lies in seismic zone III, where the Modified  grotesqueMercalli (MM) intensity scale intensity would correspond to VIII . Ground Water is commonly tapped from aquifers through dug wells in Kochi .  The major creeks/river are Chillavanoor near Elankulam, Kaniyampuzha near Vytilla and  Chem bakkara near Thykoodam . The ground water quality was monitored for bore wells at Aluva, Eranakulam South, Kalamassery and Petta through single grab sample . The pH ranged between 6.7 to 7.0, well within the specified standard of 6.5 to 8.5 .  Kochi’s maximum temperatures range between 28.9°C to 32.7°C with minimum temperature in the range of 22.1°C . The physico-rophicchemi cal characteristics such as pH, total hardness, chlorides, dissolved solids, sulphates and nitrates  were within limits . Coliforms were not observed in all samples .  Air Quality was monitored at 7 locations as Aluva, Apollo Tyre, Edapally Junction, South Ernakulum (Railway Staff Quarters), Vytilla (Era –Ranken Site Office), Thaikoodam (opposite Ramkrishna  Mattam) and Petta.  The proposed route is not passing through any forest area or plantation area . The major tree species observed along the route are Coconut, Golden Flamboyant, Rain Tree, Mango and Jack tree . Teak is the only commercially valued tree .  No structures which were having archaeological importance as per archeological survey of India list were observed along the metro rout from Aluva to Petta . For construction of around 25 km stretch of Kochi Metro, around 40 Ha land is required . Land acquisition is being done though negotiated purchase .  A separate study for collection  of socioeconomic profile of land sellers is being carried out which will then lead to Reh abilitation  and Rese ttlement (R&R) plan and Social Man agement Plan for affected/displaced families .  The proposed metro line is in well-developed urban area with prominent commer cial and mixed landuse . The metro alignment is not passing through any forest area . Limited loss due to tree cutting (477 no.) is anticipated due to project .  Kochi Metro station entries have been planned in such a way to provide easy access for passengers from main bus terminals . The total refuse generated at each station will be about 4.5 T/day on the assumption that only about 25 % of the passengers visiting various stations will be producing  reuse .  The platforms, open space, staircase and escalator areas for elevated  metro will have adequate lighting and ventilation . Sewage generated in each station can be disposed to a combination of septic tank and  soak pit facility . Disposal for solid waste, sewage & sludge will be finally handled by Kochi Municipal authorities .  The soil excavated for pile foundation and piling waste collected from the  construction sites are main waste components . Run off from unprotected excavated areas, at  foundation locations and at construction sites can lead to soil erosion . Problems could arise from dumping of construction spoils (Concrete, bricks) waste materials (from contractor camps)  The entire metro route is elevated and hence foundation work will require foundation, fill and embankmen t, thus leading to dust generation . During excavation,  site will be properly barricaded to avoid spreading of dust to nearby areas . The material will be covered by tarpaulin / plastic sheets .  Noise generation from construction equipment varies depending upon type of equipment, specific model of operation being performed and condition of equipment . Noise generation will be avoided during night time to the extent possible . Health & Safety Issue at Construction Site: Metro construction activity demand high skilled workers .  Workers are required to be provided with accommo dation facilities along with proper water supply, sanitation, drainage, health care and human waste disposal facilities . Around four lakh cubic meters of sand is required for the works of Kochi Metro .  The cement,  metal and other construction material required is procured by contractors as per the  specifications finalized with DMRC . Metro noise level studies were carried out by National Physical Laboratory for Delhi Metro . The operation of metro can cause a cumulative increase in ambient noise by  maximum  2 to 3 dB(A) in  medium and high traffic density areas .  Consider cumulative increase in ambient noise level by due to metro operation as maximum  2 to 3 dB(A) still the resulting noise is envisaged to be within National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Noise (NAAQSN) for commercial area for the respective day and night time . Water supply and Sanitation at stations has various components,  including personal use of staff, fire demand, make up water for air conditioning and ventilation .  The solid waste will be disposed off with help of Kerala Municipal Corporation . The water requirement will be met through tube wells at depot or water supply . Sewage generated in each station can be disposed to a combination of septic tank and soak pit facility . The treated water could be used for developing a greenbelt around the depot .  Metro operation are based on electricity which when compared to air pollution due to vehicles is considered as less polluting option . Solid waste generated will be taken care  by the cleaning contractor  weekly and  disposed to the authorised waste disposal sites .  Kochi City has the reported highest number of vehicles in Kerala . Traffic problems are mainly due due to growth of motor vehicles and absence of a quality public transport system . The road infrastructure in Kochi has not been able to meet the growing traffic demand .  Kochi is one of the 23 cities accounted for a much higher share of 27% in India's road accidents . Kerala ranked 3rd  with 102 number of road accidents per lakh of population . Kochi was ranked 10th  on road  accident profile of prominent cities with accident severity was noted to be 9.3.3 .  Some of the benefits which are expected from Metro are as follows:   Reduced road stress, reduced road stress and reduced traffic congestion . The traffic on metro will come from the shift majorly from buses, two wheeler  and car modes considering the comfort and convenience factor .  Metro uses electricity as main source of energy & since it has potential to attract commuters that are using less efficient road transport vehicle to the metro, it is likely to  lead to reduced fossil fuel consumption . With Metro system, large number of commu ters will  shift from road transport like public transport or private transport to metro . This shift will lead to reduction in number of kilometres travelled by road and thus will reduce the fuel consumption,  leading to reduction in air pollution .  Kochi Metro will adopt a strategy to plant 10 trees for every tree that is felled as per the DMRC’s corporate policy . For 477 trees to be cut, around 4770 tree be have to be planted . KMRL has planned to plant 8000 trees out which 5159 have already been planted .  2 Ridership Updation on Kochi Metro and Impact on Pollutants, CDM Smith . 2 ridership updation . Guidelines for felling of trees are developed which indicate that contractor shall identify chain age, number, size and type of trees that are required to be felled for which prior approval from competent authorities will be taken .  Contractors will maintain  close  coordination with the  following utility companies for shifting of the utility . Air Pollution Control Measures proposed are sprinkling of water, covering of  material transport vehicles, fencing of excavation site with high raised metal sheets . Noise & Vibration Control Measures: Ballast-less track is supported on two layers of rubber  pads to reduce track noise .  Traffic Diversion Plans will be developed to insure that  alternate routes are provided for access to all the places which have been closed or access has been restricted . The people would be informed about diversions well in advance through different communi cations channels . The help of traffic wardens and traffic police will be taken to maintain traffic flow .
